# Datomic transactor, Java and Clojure nix flake

Ever wanted to `cd` into a directory and have the Datomic transactor, Java and Clojure installed?

If so, this repo is for you.

## Installation

Install [Nix and Direnv](https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-direnv/),
enable [Nix with flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_permanently_in_NixOS)
and [hook direnv into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

I am not an expert on these matters, so you may have to google it yourself if you do not already
have installed these things. [](https://mitchellh.com/writing/nix-with-dockerfiles)

cd <folder-of-this-repo>

Yes, that's some Datomic entities transacted into and read from a "proper" Datomic transactor (using the dev protocol and H2 as storage).

## And ... ?

Well, at least it works, right*? *At least on my machine. ðŸ˜„

The point is that all the versions of Java, the transactor and Clojure
are locked and pinned. And thus you do not *need* a system wide Java installation (or anything else besides
what is mentioned in the Installation section). In some future case where the JVM breaks backwards compatibility,
this repo should still work (as it bundles its own JVM). With this setup you can also of course tweak
the versions per repo (instead of system wide) and also share an easily reproducible environment for others
to use. Just `cd` into the repo, and you should be good to go.

Hope this is useful for someone! ðŸ˜Š

How much do you need to know about `nix` to use it? I do not know much, and yet somehow I'm getting by 
just fine. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
